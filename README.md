# LED_CC_Driver
very basic and cheap constant current circuit for medium power LED's

This project is about to design a very simple LED driver circuit for medium power LED's. I'd like to play around with different LED color temperatures and shapes. 

## Revision 0 uses PLCC 2835 LED Footprint and 3528 (alternative)

# Real World Examples
I used the [timer clock project](https://github.com/LMWB/Cannelloni-al-Forno) and three of this LED boards to create a illumination of my courtyard.
